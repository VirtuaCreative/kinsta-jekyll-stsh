# Jekyll website deployed with Kinsta's Static Site Hosting and GitHub Actions

[Kinstaâ€™s Static Site Hosting](https://kinsta.com/docs/static-site-hosting/) is a
free service to deploy static files (HTML, CSS, JS).

This repository contains the codebase for a sample Jekyll site built with GitHub Actions.
The GitHub Actions workflow provides a way to deploy Jekyll's `_site` directory to a dedicated
branch of this repository before deploying it to Kinsta at every push of your repo.  For a step-by-step guide, read
